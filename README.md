## Synopsis

This project tracks the Simulation of the Gnutella Peer to Peer Self Organization Protocol.

## Code Example

All the source code resides under src. The simulator includes the discrete-event-queue based simulation framework. Actual simulation of p2p self-organization is based on several metrics and on a randomly generated p2p network topology and file storage.

## Motivation

This project was developed in the year 2003 as part of a course project to study various aspects of Distributed Systems.
