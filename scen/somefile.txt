PocoMail - My email client of choice. Small footprint, stable, and virtually immune to all those nasty viri that infect clueless and not-so-clueless Outlook users. Poco is shareware, written by a guy in Canada. Is is very configurable with a proprietary scripting language that allows you to write some fairly advanced macros. It has built in Spam filtering that works way better than the so called spam features of Outlook. Support is first rate, questions to the bulletin board on the Poco web site are almost always answered in just a few hours.

Mozilla - The only browser you need. It's standards compliant, blocks all those pesky pop up ads, and again, its far more secure than Internet Explorer.

AceHTML - A shareware clone of Homesite. They used to have a freeware version, which is what I originally used. They killed the freeware version but I was so happy with it I went ahead and payed up to get the pro version. Who says you can't make money giving away stuff on the Internet? It's nicely featured editor for all of your HTML, CSS and scripting needs. It has a small built in browser, plus you can call two external browsers from inside the program. The interface is very Homesite like. It's written by a French guy in Canada. Occasionally I'll stumbled into a help page that never got translated into English, otherwise it's a solid program and a worthy addition to your PC if you like Homesite but don't want to shell out the big bucks to license Allaire software.

Paint Shop Pro - The only program I'll ever need for image manipulation. Does 80% of what Photoshop can do for about 20% of the price. It's stable and been around for years.

EZ Trust Anti-Virus - From Computer Associates, of all people. It was free for personal use for a while, and then they started charging. I was so happy with it I stuck with it. It's less intrusive than McAfee and it cost less too. I've never had a virus get by it.

Ulead DVD PictureShow - If you want to build a DVD slide show of pictures, set to music, this is the program for you. It's writes to either DVD or VCD mode to a CD, which will also play in most DVD players. It's simple with limited options, you line up your pics, point to a mp3 or wav file for music, set timing on the pictures, and go. It's not for authoring DVD's, it create slide slows quickly and easily.

Cetus CNote Text Editor - A Windows Notepad replacement with multi document interface and spell check. That's right - you can spell check Notepad. Why the hell didn't MS ever do this? It's freeware, and no longer supported. But how much support can you need for a text editor?

Cetus WordPad - A freeware Windows WordPad replacement with Spell-check. With this in my system I rarely bother with MS Word for quick documents. It's also no longer officially supported. Again, who cares?

FeedReader - A freeware RSS/XML headline reader. Simple 3 pane interface, alerts you when your favorite XML enabled websites are updated. Small footprint too. Can be a tad buggy, but the price is right and its not like its mission critical! I will say though, that using a headline viewer does change the browsing experience. It's much more efficient than clicking thru to every site to see if there is something new there. I'm hoping somebody builds this function right into Mozilla soon. There is one effort under way but I could not get it to work.

CD-DAX-Tractor - Open Source Encoder / Ripper for audio files. Came encode to WAV, MP3, and Ogg-Vorbis. It has got a tiny footprint, and it is blazingly
